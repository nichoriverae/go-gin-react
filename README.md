# GO, Gin, and React

A look into using GO as a back end for a React app.

## Notes
This project makes use of Gorm as a go between to the MySQL database. I have since learned that this model is pretty slow even compared to a Node server, so I will look at refactoring the code for optimization using fasthttp and postgresSQL later on.
